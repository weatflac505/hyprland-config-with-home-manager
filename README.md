# hyprland-config-with-home-manager
Very basic, non modularised hyprland configuration written in nix syntax
Currently it is as simple file to be loaded in /etc/nixos/home.nix or simple single user home manager installation.

Further developments would focus on modularising the configuration, in accordance with individual applications like waybar , kitty , widgets for swaync using eww ...

The whole configuration has been written by me solely by reading hyprland wiki ( https://wiki.hyprland.org/ ) for more info.
